# Information Security Project

## Task
*Demonstrate the understanding of data security methods/processes by implementing at least one feature to improve data security in a real-life use case
*Besides obvious features such as encryption, authentication & access control, students should consider features that help in other ares such as data classification, data leak prevention, digital rights management etc

## Project Description
I developed an Audit Manager for my Information Security assignment that tracks and monitors any events/actions occuring in an adjacent Library Portal application. My task is to implement data security for audit logs to prevent unauthorized access to the activities going on within the Library Portal. These logs should only be viewed and analysed by authorised personnel for audit/investigative purposes.
